# raspberry-pi-leds

This is a little side project I have going on using some `5050 SMD` LEDs.

I want to try and do some stuff with bluetooth audio and have the incoming
audio control the rate at which colors change and what not.

Might be cool to hook it up to a webserver to allow you to change the colors
or something as well but that's not an immediate focus for the time being.
